# Queues


Write a C program named exerciseQueuethat takes a single command-line argument, which is a filename. This input file contains instructions for queue operations. The first line of the input file is an integer 0≤𝑁𝑁 ≤105 giving the number of instructions that will follow. Each of the following 𝑁𝑁 lines contains an instruction. The possible instructions are:•enqueue X: where −109≤𝑋𝑋≤109 is  a long integer. Upon receiving this instruction, add𝑋𝑋 to the tail of the queue. There is no output from this instruction.•dequeue: remove the head element from the queue. Print the removed element on a line by itself. If the queue was empty, print QueueError.•print: print the contents of the queue, with each pair of elements separated by a single space, starting at the head (the element that would be removed by a dequeue). If the queue is empty, print Empty. The queue must be in the same state after it has been printed as it was before it was printed.You must use the generic Queue ADT described in section 7.2 of the textbook. You will have to write a function to implement the print action since it is not a method in the ADT. This function should satisfy the following signature            void printQueue(const Queue *q, FILE *fp);YouMUST use the itCreate()method in your printQueue()implementation.All output must be to standard output. Each line of output must be terminated by a newline character.
